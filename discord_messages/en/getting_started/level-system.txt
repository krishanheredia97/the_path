# Level System 📈

As you engage with the server and work on your habits, you'll earn points and level up. Here’s how it works:

### XP (Experience Points) 🌟
- Earn **1 XP** for every minute of abstinence from your bad habits.

### GP (Gold Points) 💰
- Earn **1 GP** for every 2 hours of abstinence.

### Honor Points 🏅
- Earn **1 Honor point** for each day of abstinence. These points will have more uses as you progress.

## Leveling Up 🔝
As you earn XP, you will level up and unlock new roles and content within the server.
Higher levels grant access to exclusive channels and rewards.

Keep working on your habits and watch yourself grow within the community! 💪✨
