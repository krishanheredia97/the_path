# 🎁 What are Rewards?

Rewards are incentives you give to yourself for maintaining good habits. For example, you might reward yourself with an ice cream every week you spend without smoking. When you add a reward, you need to give it a name and assign a value in GP (the server's currency), which you earn by abstaining from vices.
