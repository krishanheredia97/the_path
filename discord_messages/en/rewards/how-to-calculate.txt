# ðŸ§® How to Calculate GP for Rewards

You gain 12 GP for every day of abstinence. To calculate how much GP a reward should cost, you can use the following simple formulas:

### ðŸ“… Days
**Formula**: Total days of abstinence * 12 = GP

### ðŸ“† Weeks
**Formula**: Total weeks of abstinence * 84 = GP

### ðŸ“… Months
**Formula**: Total months of abstinence * 336 = GP

### ðŸ“– Example: Calculating GP for a New Book

If you want to set a reward for a new book:

- **Estimate**: It takes 3 weeks of abstinence.
- **Calculation**: 3 weeks * 84 = 252 GP

So, the new book would be set at around **252 GP**.
